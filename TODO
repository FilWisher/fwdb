TODO: 
o load stack of sstables on process initialization
o track size of memtable using `serialized_size`
o load config from file
o auto drop an sstable if it's badly formatted
o handle any value that is Serialize, Deserialize, (and possible Copy/Clone?)
o serialize to multiple sstables, no just the same each time
